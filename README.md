Expense Tracking Web Application
Project Overview
This Expense Tracking Web Application is designed to help individuals or businesses keep track of their financial transactions, set and manage budgets, generate reports, and visually analyze spending patterns. The application allows users to track both income and expenses, categorize their transactions, and get notified when their spending exceeds set budget limits.

This project was developed using modern web technologies like React.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and chartjs for data visualization.

Features

Budget Management: Users can set a budget limit for each category. If the transactions exceed the set budget, the system sends notifications to alert the user.
Category and Subcategory Creation: Users can create custom categories and subcategories for managing their expenses in more granular detail.
Report Generation: Users can generate reports for different time gaps (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) to analyze their spending behavior.
Visualization: The system visualizes the transaction data through interactive charts, helping users easily understand their financial situation.
Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications if they exceed their budget limits.
